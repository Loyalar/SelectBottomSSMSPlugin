# Select Bottom SSMS Plugin

This is a plugin that adds a context menu item in SQL Server Management Studio to "Select bottom x rows" instead of it only having "Select top x rows". 

I had gotten pretty annoyed with the fact that you could only select top rows, when the action I needed most of the time was actually selecting bottom rows, because those were almost always newest.

I made this plugin for SQL Server Management studio 16.5.3, and am unfortunately not sure if it works in later versions.

## Getting Started

Running the project from a Visual Studio should automatically install the extension to your SSMS.
